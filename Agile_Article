＃How It's Important To Leave Notes For Me In The Future When Setting Up Database Connections

#When spinning up a full-stack Node.js application, configuring the database connection is more
  than just another checklist item—it is the most important thing.If the backend can't read and 
  write data, the app won't work, no matter how good the frontend is.Additionally, environment 
  variables and connection strings should be hidden for security reasons.It is also important to c
  arefully manage the settings and file structure.Therefore, I need to understand "Handing Off To My 
  Future Self". 

#Experience
  When I connected MongoDB to Node.js app, I got some probles. 
  - **Forgetting the structure of the connection string**  
    I had stored the `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable, but when I resumed work a few days later, 
  I couldn’t recall the exact options or authentication method and had to revisit the documentation.

  - **Cannot figure out the date and time**
    Because I did not record the date and time of the connection test, I had difficulty figuring out 
    "when the failure occurred" during the reproduction test.

I took some actions for agile handoff 

  -- Added not only setup instructions but also **detailed connection-string notes** to `README.md`,
  including authentication formats and the driver version I used.  
  - Recorded **date and time** of each successful test both in the README and in commit messages
